 *
 * Implements a piecewise linear function
 *   value = f(key)
 * Value and key must both be numbers, roughly speaking.
 *
 * Specifically, enough operators must be defined so that
 *  value1 + (value2 - value1) * (key3 - key1) / (key2 - key1)
 * will give a result of type value. (The operations will be done in this specific order.)
 * Also it must be possible to compare keys with "<".
 *
 * This is intended to be used with simple POD types and may be very inefficient for non-POD types.
 *
 * Piecewise linear functions work by specifying output values
 * at a number of specified "key" points, and interpolating linearly for keys
 * between the key points.
 *
 * In this implementation, f is constant for keys less than the smallest specified key,
 * and constant for keys greater than the largest specified key.
 *
 * The data is stored internally as an array of pairs, sorted by key:
 * key0, value0
 * key1, value1
 * key2, value2
 * ...
 *
 * The table starts out empty and the pairs must be entered one at a time.  Duplicate keys are
 * prohibited.
 * The keys must be sorted from smallest (in entry 0) to largest; they are automatically entered
 * in the right place by insert_unique.
 *
 * This is designed to be built once, not modified, hence the lack of "remove" functions.
 * It is used to implement various economic game logic functions configured by paks.
 * As such it is instantiated with small, constant numbers of elements; although these are not
 * known at compile time, they are known early in runtime during settings loading.
